Krorms
======

Krorms is a simple JavaScript (jQuery) library that assists in menial form generating and validating operations.

It's made primarily for my own personal use on projects but feel free to use it in your own projects should you wish to! It's nothing majorly advanced and at present I've not documented it, but all functionality is demonstrated in the test.html file!
